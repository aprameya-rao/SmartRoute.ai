        <dl className="text-gray-700">
          <dt className="font-semibold mt-3">What is the average lifespan of an EV battery?</dt>
          <dd className="ml-5">Most EV batteries are designed to last 8-10 years or 160,000-240,000 km, though their performance will gradually degrade over time.</dd>

          <dt className="font-semibold mt-3">Can I sell my old EV battery?</dt>
          <dd className="ml-5">It's always best to return it through authorized channels (like the manufacturer or a certified recycler) rather than selling it informally. This ensures proper and safe handling.</dd>

          <dt className="font-semibold mt-3">Are EV batteries environmentally friendly?</dt>
          <dd className="ml-5">While their manufacturing does have an impact, the overall environmental footprint of EV batteries throughout their full lifecycle, especially with proper recycling, is significantly lower than that of internal combustion engine vehicles. This is mainly due to zero tailpipe emissions.</dd>
